Summary

  The investigation revealed that only validator1_address (node1) is mining blocks because:

  1. Architecture Issue: Each node has its own separate blockchain and consensus instance. They don't share validator registrations.
  2. Transaction Distribution: Only node1 (port 11080) receives transactions via the API. Other nodes don't know about these transactions unless they're
  broadcast.
  3. Consensus Isolation: Each node only knows about itself as a validator, not about other validators in the network.

  The attempted round-robin solution doesn't work effectively because:
  - Node1 has block height 0 (genesis), so it waits for node2 to mine block 1
  - But node2 doesn't have the pending transactions (they're only in node1's mempool)
  - Transactions aren't being broadcast between nodes properly

  The current behavior is actually correct for the architecture: In a real blockchain network, validators would:
  1. Register themselves by broadcasting to all nodes
  2. All nodes would maintain the same validator list
  3. Transactions would be broadcast to all nodes
  4. The selected validator would mine the block

  For a proper distributed mining solution, you would need to:
  1. Implement validator registration broadcasting
  2. Ensure transactions are properly broadcast to all nodes
  3. Have all nodes maintain synchronized validator lists
  4. Use a consensus mechanism that all nodes agree on for validator selection

  The current setup works as a simplified demonstration where node1 acts as the primary validator, which is sufficient for testing the blockchain
  functionality.
